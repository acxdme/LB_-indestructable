/** Dereferencing a null pointer is a common programming error.
When a null pointer is accessed, it leads to a segmentation fault or access violation, causing the program to crash.
  To avoid this, always check if a pointer is null before dereferencing it. 
Using conditional statements or pointer validation techniques can prevent null pointer dereferencing and enhance program stability and reliability.
