Q6) Question on redux-toolkit and where is the business logic written.
Ans-6) In a React with Redux application, the business logic is typically written in Redux action creators, reducers, and middleware
       Action creators handle user interactions and dispatch actions, reducers update the state based on these actions,
       and middleware (like redux-thunk or redux-saga)
       can be used for handling side effects such as API calls or asynchronous logic. This separation keeps the business logic
       centralized and maintains the presentation logic within the React components.
